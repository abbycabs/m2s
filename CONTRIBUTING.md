# Contributing to Improving participation and collaboration on Mozilla2school

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mozilla2School project .ðŸ˜º

This project is about to introduce young school-going students to the internet and help them to explore it and make them aware of the power of internet. The initiative also introduces these young minds to the latest technology and give practical trainings on using it.

We are planning a different methodology for this project in order to enhance its practical output. We introduce new technologies in both software and hardware programming to the students and give them the complete range of scope to choose from. We believe that this first step will enable them to choose their areas of interest and build a career around these areas of interest. If you want to get more information about this project, check out [Readme](README.md).
